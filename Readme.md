Kubernetes orchestratate services and manages workload, uptime and failure recovery pretty seemlessly. Services running in the cluster are expose to each other for communication and data transmission. However, these services has to respond to the outside events or internet traffic which requires a gateway which exposes a common endpoint for all the services running in the cluster. Routing to different services needs service name and labels. K8s comes with default ingress for HTTP LoadBalancing, that define rule for external connectivity to kubernetes services.

The NGINX Ingress Controller for Kubernetes provides enterpriseâ€‘grade delivery services for Kubernetes applications, with benefits for users of both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. With the NGINX Ingress Controller for Kubernetes, you get basic load balancing, SSL/TLS termination, support for URI rewrites, and upstream SSL/TLS encryption.
